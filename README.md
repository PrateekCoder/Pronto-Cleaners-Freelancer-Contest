Our new retail laundry, Pronto Cleaners, requires a simple and elegant website. We would like a one-page mock-up of the site. Our website requirements/ guidelines are as follows:

1. Our corporate colors are white and blue. 
2. Our logo should be prominently displayed (preferably on the top left-hand corner).
3. The site should be very clean and clutter-free. 
4. A mock website is created here to give you an idea of what we have mind:

This is a website Mock-up design which I made as required for the contest held on Freelancer.com
